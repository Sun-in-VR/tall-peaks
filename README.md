# Tall Peaks
Tall Peaks datapack for Minecraft: Java Edition 1.18

This datapack sets the size of the Overworld's topslide to zero, allowing terrain to generate higher than normally possible.

Essentially: This stops mountain peaks from being cut off around y 256

Additionally, the non-lite version adds an extra 64 blocks of building space at the top of the world, 
bringing the total world height up to 448 blocks, spanning from y -64 to y 384

If the non-lite version seems too laggy, give the lite version a try!
